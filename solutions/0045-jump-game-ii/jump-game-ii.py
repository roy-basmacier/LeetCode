# Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
#
# Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
#
# Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
#
# Example:
#
#
# Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
#     Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
#
# Note:
#
# You can assume that you can always reach the last index.
