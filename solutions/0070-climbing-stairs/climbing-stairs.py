# You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
#
# Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
# 1. 1 step + 1 step
# 2. 2 steps
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: 3
# Output: 3
# Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
# 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
# 2. 1 step + 2 steps
# 3. 2 steps + 1 step
#
#
# Â 
# Constraints:
#
#
# 	1 <= n <= 45
