# There are 1000 buckets, one and only one of them is poisonous, while the rest are filled with water. They all look identical. If a pig drinks the poison it will die within 15 minutes. What is the minimum amount of pigs you need to figure out which bucket is poisonous within one hour?
#
# Answer this question, and write an algorithm for the general case.
#
#  
#
# General case: 
#
# If there are n buckets and a pig drinking poison will die within m minutes, how many pigs (x) you need to figure out the poisonous bucket within p minutes? There is exactly one bucket with poison.
#
#  
#
# Note:
#
#
# 	A pig can be allowed to drink simultaneously on as many buckets as one would like, and the feeding takes no time.
# 	After a pig has instantly finished drinking buckets, there has to be a cool down time of m minutes. During this time, only observation is allowed and no feedings at all.
# 	Any given bucket can be sampled an infinite number of times (by an unlimited number of pigs).
