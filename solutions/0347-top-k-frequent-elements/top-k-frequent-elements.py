# Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
# Output: [1,2]
#
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: nums = [1], k = 1
# Output: [1]
#
#
# Note: 
#
#
# 	You may assume k is always valid, 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ number of unique elements.
# 	Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
# 	It's guaranteed that the answer is unique, in other words the set of the top k frequent elements is unique.
# 	You can return the answer in any order.
